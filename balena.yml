  BubblesNet Edge-Device is the measurement and control component of the BubblesNet system, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ based 
  device to measure the environment inside a cabinet/tent and through attached relay-controlled environmental control
  devices (heater, humidifier ...) to keep that environment in an ideal state to grow for whatever stage the crop 
  may be at.

  - Bring a sandwich to this process.  After you flash a micro-SD card and start it up, it can take 30+ minutes for the device to connect and update via Balena.


  THIS FLEET IS NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME YET. THIS BRANCH IS THE FINAL PUSH.  ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT IS MATURE AND HAS ITERATED THROUGH A NUMBER OF CROPS, I STILL HAVE TO DEBUG A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE 
  UNIQUE TO BALENA PUBLIC FLEETS. THIS REQUIRES ME TO TURN PUBLIC VISIBILITY ON AND OFF FAIRLY FREQUENTLY. PLEASE DO NOT JOIN THIS FLEET UNTIL THIS MESSAGE IS GONE.
