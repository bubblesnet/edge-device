  BubblesNet Edge-Device is the measurement and control component of the BubblesNet system, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ based 
  device to measure the environment inside a cabinet/tent and through attached relay-controlled environmental control
  devices (heater, humidifier ...) to keep that environment in an ideal state to grow for whatever stage the crop 
  may be at.

  Thanks to Balena [OpenFleets](https://hub.balena.io/organizations/gh_bubblesnet), you benefit from having automatic updates. As soon as updates are shipped, they will be deployed to your device.
